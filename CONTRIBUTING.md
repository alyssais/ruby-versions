Use `update.sh`, or manually do the following:

1. Add the new version to `versions.txt`.
  * Versions should be listed incrementally.
2. Add new _stable_ versions to `stable.txt`, replacing any previous stable version for that version family.
  * Should only contain the latest stable version for each version family.
3. Append the MD5 checksums for _all_ released files to `checksums.md5`.
4. Append the SHA1 checksums for _all_ released files to `checksums.sha1`.
5. Append the SHA256 checksums for _all_ released files to `checksums.sha256`.
6. Append the SHA512 checksums for _all_ released files to `checksums.sha512`.

* Never remove a version from `versions.txt`.
* Never remove checksums from a `checksum.*` file. Unless the file is literally
  no longer available on the Internet.
